## 📌 Project Overview

Tic Tac Toe is one of the most popular strategy games, often played on a 3x3 grid. The objective is simple: two players take turns marking spaces with `X` and `O`. The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

This project provides a **modern, browser-based version** of Tic Tac Toe with added features such as turn indication, winner highlighting, and draw detection.

## 🧩 Features

* Two-player gameplay (Player O vs Player X)
* Turn indicator to show whose move it is
* Automatic winner detection with highlighted winning combination
* Draw detection when the grid is full
* Reset and New Game buttons for replay
* Responsive design with smooth UI/UX
